        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Work Sans</h4>
        <p>Work Sans is classy and professional looking, without overbearing the reader with formality as would a font
            with serifs. It is still fun with it's line weight
            not overly childish like a comic sans</p>
        <h4 class="font">Paragraph Font: Work Sans Light </h4>
        <p>For a professional website, fonts should match in style. The body copy is the same as the header so as not to
            distract from the content.</p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and
            Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
            Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h5>
            <p class="colored">Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and
                experienced rafters. No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting
                Company
                can make it happen for you.</p>
