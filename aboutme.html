    <p>I am actually <i>from</i> Page, AZ so if you have ever been to Lake Powell, that's where all my extended family still lives. 
        I grew up in the Phoenix area so I honestly count that as my personal hometown. Right now I live in Rexburg with my husband, Shane,
        and we just got married this past summer.
        <p>I served a mission in Mexico City and have just passed my two year mark being home from the mission.
        Time passes much slower on missions. Let me tell you.</p>
        <p>My degree is in Applied Technology as I am an online student and work full time as a seamstress.
        I think I want to become a Front End Web Developer, but that is totally subject to change as this is my first semester with this declared major.
        I was about halfway through studying Illustration when I decided that it would never be a solid career for me to keep since I want to be home for my future children
        and being an illustrator will not allow that.</p>
        <p>I still paint a lot though. In fact, here is my most recent painting!</p>
